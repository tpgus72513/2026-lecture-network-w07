"""Week 7 · Task 1 — Build a learning switch.

Textbook §6.4.3 (link-layer switches, self-learning) and §6.4.1 (MAC addresses).

A switch is handed a frame and has to decide which ports to send it out of.
Nobody configures it. It works out the map by **watching where frames come
from**, which is the whole idea of self-learning, and it is about thirty lines.

The thirty lines are not the hard part. The hard part is what it does when it
does not know, and what happens to the things it learned when a machine moves.
