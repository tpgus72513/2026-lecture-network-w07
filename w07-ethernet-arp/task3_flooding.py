"""Week 7 · Task 3 — A switch that runs out of room.

Textbook §6.4.3.

A switch does not have room for every station on the network. Its forwarding
table sits in a fixed amount of fast memory, and when that fills, something has
to go. Whatever goes gets **flooded** the next time anyone sends to it - out of
every port, to every station that did not ask for it.

`NaiveSwitch` handles a full table the simplest way: throw out whichever entry
has been there longest. That is a perfectly reasonable first idea and it is
close to the worst thing you can do with this traffic.

    python3 bench.py
    python3 bench.py --yours

Correctness first: every frame whose destination is reachable must still reach
it. A switch that floods less because it delivers less is not a switch.

    `self.table` must exist and must never hold more than `capacity` entries.
    The harness checks this after every frame.

    What the baseline gets wrong: it decides what to keep by **when the entry
    arrived**, and that has nothing to do with whether it is about to be needed.
    On this trace a handful of stations carry most of the traffic, and the
    baseline keeps throwing them out to make room for stations that spoke once.

    Two questions worth separating:

      * which entry should leave when the table is full?
      * should learning a new source ever be *declined*?

    The second one is less obvious and is worth thinking about before you
    dismiss it.

    Note what you are NOT allowed to do: you cannot look at `where`, you cannot
    see the future, and you cannot hold more than `capacity` entries. Everything
    you know comes from the frames you have already handled.
